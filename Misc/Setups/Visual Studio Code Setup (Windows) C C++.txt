Note	:	Code written in linux enviroment and for linux enviroment will not be compilable in windows enviroment.
Recommendation	:	Use of CMake is recomended to make the code cross platform, this will not omit the issue of
					use platform dependednt libraries but it will make writing cross platform code easier.

1.	Download VSC from officla microsoft website : https://code.visualstudio.com/download

2.	Install VSC using the installer downloaded in Step-1

3.	Setting up VSC for C/C++ developemnt
	a.	Install MingW
		- 	Go to http://www.mingw.org/
		- 	Go to Download TAB in top right corner
		- 	Download mingw-get-setup.exe
		- 	Run mingw-get-setup.exe
		Note : Default location of location should be C:\MinGW , if not then edit it.
		-	After some downloads 'continue' button will be enabled, click the continue button
		-	Select following packages for installation (these are specific to C/C++ developemnt)
			*	mingw-developemnt-toolkit
			*	mingw32-base
			*	mingw32-gcc-g++
			*	msys-base
		-	In the MinGW Installation Manager go to Installation > Apply Changes , click on Apply on dialog-box [This will start the download and installation of required packages]
	b.	Editing the enviroment variable
		-	Open control panel
		-	Click on System and Security
		-	Click on System
		-	Click on Advance system settings
		-	Click on Environment variables
		-	Choose the Path enviroment variable in System variables
		-	Double click on it
		-	Add new varibale by clicking on New
		-	Paste this path C:\MinGW\bin
		-	Click OK
		-	Click OK
		-	Click OK
	c. Check if MinGW is working or not
		-	Open command prompt
		-	Type the following command to check the version of g++
			*	g++ --version
		-	If above mentioned step gives a valid output then that means MinGW is installed and working properly else repeate the installation
	d.	Setup VSC
		-	Install the officla C/C++ extension 
			*	Go to extension button (On left side bar)
			*	Search for C++
			* 	Install the extension by Microsoft
			*	Reload the VSC (Close and re-open VSC)
		-	Edit configurations
			*	Open command pallet by pressing ctrl+shift+p
			*	Search for C/C++:Edit Configurations (UI)
			*	Set compiler path to C:/MinGW/bin/g++.exe
				Note	:	instead of typing this option can also be selected from drop down list avaibale
			*	Set IntelliSense mode to : gcc-x64
			*	Include C++ include files in includePath
				-	In include path add this path in new line : "C:\MinGW\lib\gcc\mingw32\{YOUR_VERSION_OF_MINGW}\include\c++"
	
	NOTE	:	We require task.json and launch.json to compile our code in VSC , if that information is required I can add that to the document.
